# Create Branch Command

Create a new branch with a name following conventional naming patterns.

## Behavior
1. Analyze the context of current changes or user intent
2. Create a branch with appropriate prefix:
   - `feat/` - New features
   - `fix/` - Bug fixes
   - `refactor/` - Code refactoring
   - `docs/` - Documentation changes
   - `test/` - Test additions or modifications
   - `chore/` - Maintenance tasks
3. Use kebab-case for the branch name after the prefix

## Examples
- `feat/user-authentication`
- `fix/login-validation-error`
- `refactor/api-client-structure`
- `docs/readme-update`
