## Code Quality Review: {TASK_DESCRIPTION}

**Overall Assessment:** GOOD / ACCEPTABLE / NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

**Files Reviewed:**
- `path/to/file.ts`

**Findings:**

**Positive:**
- [What's done well]

**Issues (if any):**
| Severity | File:Line | Issue | Suggestion |
|----------|-----------|-------|------------|
| LOW/MED/HIGH | file.ts:42 | [Problem] | [Fix] |

**Simplification Opportunities:**
- [Suggestions from code-simplifier]

**Recommendations:**
- [Optional improvements, not blockers]

## Severity Guide

- **HIGH:** Security issue, bug, or breaking problem - must fix
- **MED:** Code smell, maintainability issue - should fix
- **LOW:** Style preference, minor improvement - nice to have

## Rules

- Use the code-review-excellence skill - don't invent criteria
- Focus on the changed code, not the entire codebase
- Be constructive - provide actionable suggestions
- HIGH severity = implementation loop back needed
- MED/LOW = note but don't block progress
- Don't nitpick style if it matches existing codebase patterns
```
